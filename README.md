# 😎Tasks

Tasks helps your computer run faster by allowing you to clean trash, remove bloatware as well as control startup programs and an advanced task manager, allowing you to check if any apps are maliciously eating your computer CPU and RAM without you knowing in the background.


# ✅Features

- Cleanup Folders such as Prefetch, Downloads, Temp and empty your Recycle Bin easily.
- Allow and disallow processes that run on start.
- An advanced task manager that gives you more information than the old Windows `taskmgr`.
- Remove bloatware from your computer on a click of a button.
- Blacklist sites that are known to be malicious or point to malicious websites.
- Check your PC Info with a glance.
- Discord RPC included!

# 🦺Prerequisites

To be able to run Tasks, you will need the following:
- [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3005) or higher.


# 🎁Setup

Tasks is a portable program (for now). You can head to the Releases page, choose the latest version, download the zip file (**Note**: Not the Source Code zip file). Extract the zip file, and execute the *.exe* file in the extracted files. You can now experience the program!


# 📐Branch Information

The **master** branch holds the most stable updates for the project, and if you are not looking to the experimental side, or just want to simply use Tasks, then feel free to visit the **master** branch for source code.

The **testing** branch is meant for testing features on the project, and it is not as stable as master. New stuff get added to this branch, but they will not be quite stable and may either work as intended or not.
